combined_csvs_check doesn't work because some section of the data is shifted right by one column
includes:
erin_feb2021_backup2.csv
may2018pulls_emw.csv
PairExperimentStringpullBatch2Sept11.csv
stringpull2019_EMWjuly26_Ani.csv
stringpullbackup_may2019.csv
stringpulldata6.csv
stringpullsoctober2018_EMW_2.csv

same files as in combined_csv_files_cleaned which previously worked so will use that
 but with new songsplayed_sorted_forcode because I edited that when I found some FD song files listed incorrectly as UD

ran combined_csv_files_junelyrebirdtaylor_cleaned
error at after running the loop that starts at line 84 in the R code
ran lapply (data_pass, class) and lapply (cleaned_subset, class) and found that all columns as characters (Except for count)

ran combined_csv_files_cleaned
no error
ran lapply (data_pass, class) and lapply (cleaned_subset, class) and found key_pecked as integer
2 instances of "more than two tests"

on combined_csv_files_junelyrebirdtaylor_cleaned, 
ran this after line 15:
data$key_pecked <- as.numeric(data$key_pecked)
no warnings, worked
5 instances of "more than two tests
this time rest of code "worked" obv need to verify but no errors

will keep combined_csvs_files_cleaned and combined_csv_files_junelyrebirdtaylor_cleaned
 but will now make a cleaned_merged_csvs that will merge these two csvs

ran cleaned_merged_csvs
and
data$key_pecked <- as.numeric(data$key_pecked)
5 instances of more than two tests
completed R code successfully
